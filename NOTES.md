- stripe email set to customer sign up email, remains that unless explicitly changed
- show billing email on account
- one active sub per customer
- free forever (with usage)
- pro plan has higher usage (now we already have the payment info tho)
- also allow downgrading

use case
- free teir with usage limits active users
    1. once active users are met - show pop up with bill ($X amount per user)
    2. after a certain time duration lock the access (5 min)




NEXT STEPS
- keep doc store? Switch to postgres sql with local compatibility?
